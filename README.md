# Portfolio for data science
---
Central repository for navigation for all data science related projects.

This is a central repository documenting my journey through machine learning algorithms and their applications to relevant problems. It contains academic and hobbyist work as well as projects inspired by current business problems.

## Contents
- ### Deep Learning 
    - [Document Summarisation using Keras](https://github.com/MrFlygerian/NLP-Document-Summary/blob/master/Document_Summariser_(control).ipynb): Deep learning model built using Keras to summarise a document in a paragraph. A well-studied, 'control' document is used (Alice in wonderland) in order to compare results to 'real world data' in the form of some old essays I wrote (the 'real world data' is not shown).
    - [Matching questions across languages with Tensorflow](https://github.com/MrFlygerian/FAQ_matcher/blob/master/FAQ_matcher_notebook.ipynb): Using the multilingual universal sentence encoder in order to match questions across laguages, in affect teaching the encoder to translate across languages.   
    
    
- ### Natural Language Processing
     - [Twitter sentiment analysis](https://github.com/MrFlygerian/TwitterSentimentAnalysis): Analysing tweets to extract their sentiment using Naive Bayes, with custom error evaluation in the form of nltk pos taggers.
     
     - [Twitter and WordClouds](https://github.com/MrFlygerian/WordClouds/blob/master/WordClouds.ipynb): The creation of word clouds from two sources: a given twitter timeline and a given set of twitter search term results.

    _Tools_: NLTK, NaiveBayes, Twitter API, Wordclouds


- ### Beginner Projects
   - [Recommendation Systems](https://github.com/MrFlygerian/MusicRecommender/blob/master/Recommenders.ipynb): A recommendation system for songs built from two data tables of a million instances each.
      - [Link to pre-processing file](https://github.com/MrFlygerian/MusicRecommender/blob/master/MusicDataPreprocessing.py).
    
    - [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/MrFlygerian/LogisticRegression): Simple implementation of logistic regression for determine gender from weight and height coupled with some manufactured data for graphical purposes.
    
    - [Linear Regression for Boston House Prices](https://github.com/MrFlygerian/BostonHousePrediction): Predicting house prices on the popular Boston house dataset using a Decision Tree for Regression. GridSearch is implemented to analyse and visualise optimisation parameters (max depth, nearest neighbours).  
   
   _Tools_: Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Decision Trees 
   

- ### Challenges and Projects
    - [Predicting House Prices](https://github.com/MrFlygerian/Predicting-House-Price/blob/master/Kaggle%20comp%20Notebook.ipynb): Predicting House Prices with advanced linear regression techniques. A Kaggle competition.
      
    - [Tweet Classification](https://github.com/MrFlygerian/Tweet-classification/blob/master/Kaggle%20Comp%20Notebook.ipynb): Classifying tweets as real or fake disasters using NLP. A Kaggle competition.
    - [Novoic ML Image Challenge](https://github.com/MrFlygerian/portfolio-for-data-science/blob/master/Blessed_Image_Novoic_ML_challenge.ipynb): Open ended challenge, where I tested the power of imagenet weights for classifying photographs by thier most dominant features. The link to the original challange can be found [here](https://github.com/novoic/ml-challenge/blob/master/image_challenge.ipynb).

I also have a SoundCloud to showcase my production work, some of which is augmented with data science, as well as a blog in which I talk about many different things. Links:
