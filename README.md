# Portfolio for data science
Central repository for navigation for all data science related projects.

This is a central repository documenting my journey through machine learning algorithms and their applications to relevant problems. It contains academic and hobbyist work as well as projects inspired by current business problems.

## Contents
- ### Deep Learning 
    - [Document Summarisation using Keras](https://github.com/MrFlygerian/NLP-Document-Summary): Deep learning model built using Keras to summarise a document in a paragraph. A cwell studied, 'control' document is used (Alice in wonderland) in order to compare results to 'real world data' in the form of some old essays I wrote.
    
- ### Natural Language Processing
     - [Twitter sentiment analysis](https://github.com/MrFlygerian/TwitterSentimentAnalysis): Analysing tweets to extract thier sentiment using Niave Bayes, with custom error evaluation in the form of nltk pos taggers.
     
     - [Twitter and WordClouds](https://github.com/MrFlygerian/Twitter-and-WordCloud): The creation of word clouds from two sources: a given twitter timeline and a given set of twitter search term results.

    _Tools_: NLTK, NiaveBayes, Twitter API, Wordclouds

     
- ### Business Projects
     - [Monitoring product prices with scrapy](https://github.com/MrFlygerian/PriceTracker): Creating a price tracker for various websites using the Scrapy web scraping framework to use data science for predicting changes in pricing strategy over time.
     
     _Tools_: Scrapy, css


- ### Beginner Projects
    - [Recommendation Systems](https://github.com/MrFlygerian/MusicRecommender): A recommendation system for songs built from two data tables of a million instances each.
    
    - [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/MrFlygerian/LogisticRegression): Simple implemtation of logistic regression for determing gender from weight and height coupled with some manufactured data for graphical purposes.
    
    - [Linear Regression for Boston House Prices](https://github.com/MrFlygerian/BostonHousePrediction): Predicting house prices on the popular boston house dataset using a Decision Tree for Regression. GridSearch is implemented to analyse and visualise optimisation parameters (max depth, nearest neighbours).  
   
   _Tools_: Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Decision Trees

I also have a soundcloud to showcase my production work, some of which is augmented with data science, as well as a blog in which I talk about many different things. Links:
